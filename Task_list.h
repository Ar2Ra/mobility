    hall_timeout

    This function solves the following problem:
        if the motors are running and then they are stopped quickly, it's possible that
        the Hall sensors will retain a value greater than zero, even though the axis isn't rotating
        [because no more timer capture interrupts are generated to update the motor speed]
*/

/*
    energy_adc

    This function starts an ADC conversion on one of the three channels
    (battery voltage, motor1 resistor shunt voltage, motor2 resistor shunt voltage)
    Each time this function is called a different channel is sampled (through rotation)
