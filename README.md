Mobility Platform

The project is aimed to develop a solution for WITs mobility. The mobility platform has to
offer a set of movement primitives such as motor speed control, position and orientation
control of the WIT.
The platform should use electrical DC motors with optical encoders or hall sensors.
Controlling algorithms should provide antislip movement of the wheels (starting ramp +
stopping ramp). Power mananagement for Li-Ion accumulators battery (used only for
mobility platform) must be provided (excessive discharge protection, charge profile).
